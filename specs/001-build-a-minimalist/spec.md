# Feature Specification: Conference Talk Ranking Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-minimalist`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a minimalist, privacy-first terminal user interface application to rank conference talk proposals using the Elo rating system. The purpose is to provide conference reviewers a simple, distraction-free tool to compare small sets of talks, update rankings dynamically, and surface the best proposals transparently. The application should prioritize simplicity, maintainability, and testability, enabling efficient and fair decision-making without sharing sensitive data externally. The focus is on the what and why: facilitating unbiased, user-friendly evaluations that scale to medium-sized submission pools while respecting conflict-of-interest constraints."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A conference reviewer receives a collection of talk proposals and needs to evaluate them fairly to identify the best submissions. The reviewer uses the terminal application to load proposals, compare them in pairs, trios, or quartets, make quick decisions on which is better, and generate a final ranking. The process is distraction-free, preserves privacy by keeping all data local, and provides transparent results based on accumulated comparisons.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a set of talk proposals in a supported format, **When** the reviewer loads them into the application, **Then** all proposals appear as unranked items ready for comparison
2. **Given** unranked proposals, **When** the reviewer initiates comparison, **Then** the system presents two, three or four proposals side-by-side for evaluation
3. **Given** proposals displayed for comparison, **When** the reviewer selects the preferred proposal(s), **Then** Elo ratings are updated and the next optimal group is presented
4. **Given** completed comparisons, **When** the reviewer requests current rankings, **Then** proposals are displayed ordered by Elo rating with confidence indicators
5. **Given** an active ranking session, **When** the reviewer saves progress, **Then** all data persists locally for resuming later
6. **Given** completed evaluations, **When** the reviewer exports results, **Then** a clean ranking list is generated without exposing personal review data

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are conflict-of-interest constraints between reviewer and specific proposals?
- How does the system handle ties in Elo ratings for final ranking display?
- What occurs if the reviewer wants to skip a particular comparison without making a choice?
- How does the application behave when proposal data contains incomplete or malformed information?
- What happens when the reviewer wants to restart rankings or reset all progress?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST load conference talk proposals from local files in common formats
- **FR-002**: System MUST present proposals in clean, distraction-free groupwise comparisons
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement Elo rating algorithm to update rankings after each comparison
- **FR-004**: System MUST display current rankings sorted by Elo score with confidence metrics
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist all data locally without external network communication
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle conflict-of-interest constraints by excluding specific proposal groups from comparison
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow reviewers to skip comparisons without affecting rankings
- **FR-008**: System MUST export final rankings in clean, shareable formats
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide session management for saving and resuming review progress
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate proposal data integrity and handle malformed inputs gracefully
- **FR-011**: System MUST operate entirely through terminal interface without external dependencies
- **FR-012**: System MUST complete ranking sessions for medium-sized pools (50-200 proposals) efficiently

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Application MUST start and respond to user input within 200ms
- **NFR-002**: Memory usage MUST remain under 100MB for typical proposal sets
- **NFR-003**: All data MUST remain local with zero external network communication for privacy
- **NFR-004**: Interface MUST be keyboard-only navigable for accessibility
- **NFR-005**: Application MUST work on standard terminal environments without additional installations

### Key Entities

- **Proposal**: Individual talk submission with title, abstract, speaker information, and metadata
- **Reviewer**: Person conducting the evaluation with potential conflict-of-interest constraints
- **Comparison**: Record of gourpwise evaluation decision with timestamp and context
- **Ranking Session**: Complete evaluation cycle with proposals, comparisons, and final Elo-based ordering
- **Elo Rating**: Dynamic scoring system that updates based on groupwise comparison outcomes
